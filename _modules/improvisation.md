title : Improvisation
---

Composing for improvisation is one way to frame writing music for interaction. You create the framework over which your listeners can explore and create over.

There is nearly always a "vocabulary" to improvisation - a style of playing which fits within the context/genre of the piece.

As the composer of an improvisatory piece, you are writing that language. 

### Baroque / Early Music

Musicians and singers in the Baroque and Renaissance period improvised ornamentation, chord progressions, melodies, and harmonies. Keyboard players improvised entire pieces. 

During the Baroque period, common styles of ornamentation and voice leading become more codified and fixed into compositions.

> The keyboard (or other chord-playing instrument) player realizes a continuo part by playing, in addition to the notated bass line, notes above it to complete chords, either determined ahead of time or improvised in performance.

### Jazz

Basic structure often looks like this: 
Head - Solos - (Recap of the Head) - Solos - Head - (Out)

Jazz Improvisation usually refers to improvising a set of notes over certain harmonies. The "chart" outlines the "head" melody and the accompanying chords. After playing through once or twice, the ensemble would then create new melodies over the given harmonies.

#### Free Improvisation

Improvised music not constrained to given harmonies/melodies. But is often still performed within the constraints of an idiom.

> Javanese performers have the freedom to "develop" a theme, to edit a piece, to drastically vary the tempo and dynamics...
> There are many Javanese terms that may be translated loosely as improvisation: kembangan (literally "flowering"), improvisation that adds beauty; isen-isen ("filling"), improvisation that pleasantly fills a vacuum; ngambang ("floating"), improvisation produced by musicians who do not have a clear knowledge of where the music is going; sambang-rapet ("making a tight connection"), covering up a fellow performer's mistake in order to save him or her from embarrassment; and finally, ngawur ("blunder"), an out-of-style or irrelevant improvisation.

### Drum Circle

> In 1991, during testimony before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging, Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart stated:

> Typically, people gather to drum in drum "circles" with others from the surrounding community. The drum circle offers equality because there is no head or tail. It includes people of all ages. The main objective is to share rhythm and get in tune with each other and themselves. To form a group consciousness. To entrain and resonate. By entrainment, I mean that a new voice, a collective voice, emerges from the group as they drum together.

Community vs Conducted?
