### Acoustic Interfaces

* Sound source and interface are the same. 
* Fixed mapping. 
* Haptic Feedback. 

### Electronic Instruments

* Sound and interface are separated by Mapping
* No built in feedback. 
* Indirect / Abstract mapping possible. 

### Purpose / Context

The purpose / context of the interface is extremely important. 

* Is the user an expert of amateur?
* What sort of music is created with the instrument?
* How might an interface for composition be different than an instrument for improvisation?
* Ergonomics?
* Relationship between performer and audience. 
	* Is it clear what the performer is doing? How she is manipulating sound?
	* How does this change in the context of interactive music which might not have the same notion of audience?


## Interaction Model

The interaction model is how people use the interface and how it responds to them (and importantly, how they respond back to it responding). Feedback!

### Improvisatory Interaction Model

### Performative Interaction Model

The above models, but add in another feedback loop in which the audience listening affects the performer. 

### Feedback / Feedforward

Helps articulating control. 
Active Engagement. 
Clarity of intent.

**Is it possible to create an interface which is expressive for both novices and advanced players?**

## Prepared Instruments

Prepared instruments modify existing instruments with additional composed elements.
