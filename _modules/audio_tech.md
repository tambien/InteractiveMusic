Some of the basics of working with digial audio/amplitifcation/microphones and speakers. 

## A/D & D/A

### D/A

Convert the digital audio signals inside your computer to an analog signal.

### A/D

Takes analog signal from a microphone or instrument and samples it into a digital signal. 

#### Sampling Rate

Any sampling rate above CD Quality (44.1k) is sufficient for the majority of audio applications. Remember that bit depth plays a much bigger role in signal-to-noise ratio than the sampling rate. Very high sampling rates such as 96k or 192k are useful only in a handful of cases such as when you need to be able to slow the audio down significantly or for certain audio processing plugins. 

### Audio Interface

An audio interface (somtimes called a Sound Card) is an important piece of equipment to understand for doing audio I/O for a concert, installation or instruments. The job of an audio interface is ADC and DAC. 

A typically audio interface will have at least 2 outputs. Many have up up to 16 or more. These are the outputs which you connect to your speakers

### Speakers

Speakers come in a range of sizes and types. The primary metric of speakers is their cone-size which is proportional to the frequency they can produce. Larger cones can produce lower frequencies. 

#### Active

Active speakers are very easy to work with. They are self powered (i.e. have an "on" switch in the back) and have their own volume know typically. 

#### Passive

Passive speakers have no built in amplifier and require a powered amplifier for them to make any sound. They are much less expensive than Active speakers. 

### Microphone

Microphones are defined by their transducer type (dynamic, condenser) and their directional pattern (cardioid, omni, shotgun). 

A dynamic microphone will only pick up signal which is very close to it. This is useful for loud and live situations to avoid feedback. 

If working with microphones and amplification, it's important to match the type and directional pattern of the microphones to the placement and gain of the speakers.
