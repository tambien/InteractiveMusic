## ASSIGNMENT - Parameters

Pick a musical constraint/parameter, make a piece of music which explores that dimension. 1-2 minutes. Email me an audio recording and a brief description including what parameter you composed with. Could be low-tech/no-tech. Please encode it as an mp3. I like [this](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xld/) mp3 encoder if you don't already have one.

### Yurika Mulase - Two Six Eight 

Misunderstood the assignment a bit but I created 8 chords consisting of sixths and seconds and used 2 different random number generators to determine which chord to play (1-8) and for how long (1-6 beats).

### Marc Abi-Samra and Yurika - Earthbound Spaceman

Marc and Yurika made a website that produces a melody when you scroll down while showing a man journeying from the moon back down to Earth. Our parameters were to create a music-box melody in p5. It is also in the unusual key of A Dorian.

### S.M - 10 Methods of Measuring
10 chosen sounds or groups of players playing the gamelon during burial ceremonies, starting at the same time and finishing their part at different times. Inspired by In C by Terry Riley, and reflecting on the lifespan of people born at the same time, and passing away at varying rates.
